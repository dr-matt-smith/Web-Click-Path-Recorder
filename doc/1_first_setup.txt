Web-Click-Path-Recorder - user guide
========================

do these steps once to set things up for using the web click path recorder ...

==================
location of files
==================
copy the usertracker folder into your webserver ROOT folder
e.g.

	## if using Laragon	
	\www
	
	## if using MAMP	
	\htdocs
	
	or
	## if using USB Webserver	
	\root (if USB webserver) 
	
	etc.

==================
DB structure and contents
==================
this application uses a MySQL database - so you need to set one up

locate the SQL text file which will setup the tables and initial content
last time I looked this was located here:
    zz_TRACKER_FILES/db/user_tracking.txt

NOTE: before running these SQL commands, create a new Database matching the name in the SQL text
last time I checked it was as follows:
--
-- Database: `USER_TRACKING`
--

==================
DB user and password
==================
a DB user needs to be setup with authorisation to work with the database

the DB username and password can be found in this file:
    zz_TRACKER_FILES/INCLUDE_db_connect.php
    
last time I checked the username/password were as follows:
$username = "fred";
$password = "smith";

NOTE:
take responsibility for your own security setup
e.g.
restrict access to 'localhost'
change the DB username and password if the computer you're running the app on has any external internet access etc.
