Step 2a: organise things for a new website to investigate

(1)
replace contents of folder "website" with the website files you wish to test

i.e.
- delete contents of folder "website"
- copy the website folder you wish to test into the  folder "website"

(2)
run the Java pre-process in folder
	\javaPreProcess\

this creates a version of your website in folder "modifiedWebsite"
- it makes all pages PHP and adds the user tracking code to each file
- it also updates all links inside your pages to link to the .php version of your filenames

(go on, take a look inside folder "modifiedWebsite" to see how it has changed)

(3) execute the Java file "PreProcess.class" in this folder

(WINDOWS users)
run (double click) the BAT file in
	\aa______preProcess_website.bat

(3 - Mac users)
double click the file "PreProcess.class" 

you should see status messages appear as you run the file
(you might want to check through to ensure there are no ERROR messages
- this is prototype software ...)

NOTE
Feel free to explore the Java source code for the pre-processor â€“ it is an example of a non-trivial Java program, although it has been written in a simple, rather than efficient way, so should be reasonably straightforward to understand
