Step 2b: How to run the web click path recorder for current website 

(1)
ensure your webserver and MySQL database are running

(2) 
in your web browser visit the index page in 
	\Web-Click-Path-Recorder\
	(your browser should then execute the index.php home page ...)
	
HINT - I recommend you BOOKMARK this page 
so it is easy to return to

(3)
the home page does 2 things:

- this will ask you to enter a username and task number
- offers links to view the list of user logs stored to date

(4)
having logged in your test user, let them try to complete the task you have set them

(5)
you should now have a set of logs for this user/task in the DB 
- this data should form part of your website evaluation evidence

HINT
if the user got stuck /  required any assistance then you may with to add a note to the appropriate record in the USER_LOG table

(6)
you might like to use the halfviz output to see a visualisation of the user path through the website ...
